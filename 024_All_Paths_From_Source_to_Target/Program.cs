                Given a directed, acyclic graph of N nodes.  Find all possible paths from node 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order.
                The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  
                graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.

                Example:
                Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
                Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
                
                Explanation: The graph looks like this:
                0--->1
                |    |
                v    v
                2--->3
                There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.

                Note:
                    The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range [2, 15].
                    You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.
